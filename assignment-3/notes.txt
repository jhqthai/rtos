Notes:
Write 2 separte programs.
Program 1 - CPU scheduling and FIFOs
Program 2 - Deadlock detection and Signal

prg_1

2 threads in prg_1
Thread 1 
- Do Shortest-remaining -time-first
- Determine average waiting time and turn-around time
- Write awt and tat to CPU memory using FIFOs

Thread 2
- Read from memory
- Output to textfile "output.txt"


prg_2
Detect deadlock -> report it

Read information from "Topic2_Prg_2.txt" file
Do deadlock detection algorithm LOL
Print process ID of deadlocks
Write result to "output_topic2.txt" (notify user when writing complete)

Extra: Get program to generate Gantt-chart on console loool




------------------------
prg_1
step 1 
- Create threads
- Test threads

step 2
- do srtf

-> is a shorthand for (*x).field, where x is a pointer to a variable of type struct account, and field is a field in the struct, such as account_number.

If you have a pointer to a struct, then saying

accountp->account_number;

is much more concise than

(*accountp).account_number;
