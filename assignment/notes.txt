Notes:

Create 3 threads
- read data from one file
- write data to another file (using pipe)
  
Run 3 threads iteratively after created a pipe
---------
Thread A    - writes one line of characters to pipe
            - from data.txt to pipe

Thread B    - reads data from pipe
            - PASS* data to thread C

Thread C    - read passed data
            - determine* data region
            - if data from content region, write to "src.txt"

Thread A read last line = nearly finish
-> can have a bool turn on
-> Thread C finish and if bool is on;
--> end all threads
--> returns total time.

Todo:
pass param
write to pipe
